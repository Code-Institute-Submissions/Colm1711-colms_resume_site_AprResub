### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals
    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about Colm and his current experience to see if he is a candidate for role.
    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.

    ![navigation](/assets/images/Nav.JPG)

    * Because navigation is easier on mobile options in navigation menu on mobile reduces but fills out the section anchors as device screen gets larger to help easier navigation.

    ![mobile_navigation](assets/images/mob_nav.JPG)

    * There is an anchor button on right hand side that makes it easy back to the top of the page without scrolling up.

### User Experience Feedback
  * Users got confused when the line below Colm resume extended with menu appearing on screen when going into aspect mode on mobile so moved line to below Colm resume heading.

  * Email input validation was not set up properly on contact form and user could fill in invalid email. Fixed this by adding type email attribute to input.

  * Font on wide screen monitors was deemed to small so added additional media query to CSS for larger screen. Also made adjustents to contact form based on user feedback.

  * Redesigned submit and reset buttons on contact form as they displayed incorrectly when moved into orientation mode on mobile.

  * Increased font size for Heading 1 to make main purpose of site more prominent.

  * Added contact form button to end of Projects section after user feedback of more links.

### Further Testing

### Solved Bugs
