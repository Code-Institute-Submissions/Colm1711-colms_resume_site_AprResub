### User Experience Feedback
  * Users got confused when the line below Colm resume extended with menu appearing on screen when going into aspect mode on mobile so moved line to below Colm resume heading.

  * Email input validation was not set up properly on contact form and user could fill in invalid email. Fixed this by adding type email attribute to input.
